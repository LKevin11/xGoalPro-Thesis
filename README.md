# xGoalPro - Football Match Predictor & Analysis Tool

**xGoalPro** is a Python and PyQt-based desktop application designed for football fans and sports bettors. Developed as a BSc thesis project at **Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE)**, this software leverages statistical data and machine learning models to predict match outcomes, analyze team performance, and provide a gamified experience for users.

## 📖 About the Project

The primary goal of xGoalPro is to assist football enthusiasts in making data-driven decisions. By aggregating data from various sources (teams, players, bookmaker odds), the application offers detailed insights into upcoming matches.

Users can view historical performance, analyze detailed statistics (goals, assists), and compare predictions generated by different machine learning models. Additionally, the application features a built-in minigame with a global leaderboard to engage users beyond statistical analysis.
